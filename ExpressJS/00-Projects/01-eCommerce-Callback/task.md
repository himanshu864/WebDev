# Scenario 1: Callbacks and Callback Hell

**Problem Statement:**
You're building an e-commerce platform, and during the checkout process, you need to perform several asynchronous tasks:

1. Verify the user's payment details.
2. Check the item availability.
3. Process the order if everything is in order.

Implement a checkout system using callbacks for each task, ensuring that the code structure avoids Callback Hell.

**Constraints:**

- Use callback functions for each asynchronous task.
- Refactor the code to prevent Callback Hell using techniques such as named functions or modularization.
